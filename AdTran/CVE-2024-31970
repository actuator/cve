> AdTran SRG 834-5 HDC17600021F1 devices (with SmartOS 11.1.1.1) have SSH enabled by default, accessible both
> over the LAN and the Internet. During a window of time when the device is being set up, it uses a default username and
> password combination of admin/admin with root-level privileges. An attacker can exploit this window to gain unauthorized root access by
> either modifying the existing admin account or creating a new account with equivalent privileges. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands.

> [Attack Vectors]
> The SSH protocol interface is enabled by default and exposed to the
> LAN & Internet using default password of admin/admin with root level
> privileged permissions. During setup the GUI does require an admin
> password be setup which would change the exposed admin account.
> However given that the initial vulnerable admin account is a
> privileged account with unrestricted access an attacker could change
> or add an additional account that also has privileged access and
> authenticate via SSH even after setup is complete by the user. Many
> other commands are also available including a remote firmware by
> specifying a web URL amongst other actions.
