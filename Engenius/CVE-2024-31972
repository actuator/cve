> EnGenius ESR580 A8J-EMR5000 devices allow a remote attacker to conduct stored XSS attacks that could lead to arbitrary JavaScript code execution (under the context of the user's session) via the Wi-Fi SSID input fields. 
Web scripts embedded into the vulnerable fields this way are executed immediately when a user logs into the admin page.
> This affects /admin/wifi/wlan1 and /admin/wifi/wlan_guest.

> [Attack Vectors]
> A remote attacker with access to the admin page can perform stored XSS
> attacks by inserting web scripts into the Wi-Fi name fields. This
> vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. A remote
> attacker with administrative privileges to the router's web management
> interface can exploit this flaw by embedding arbitrary JavaScript code
> within the Wi-Fi SSID field. This malicious code is executed
> immediately when a user logs into the admin page which could
> potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed under the
> context of the user's session, such as session hijacking, data theft,
> or redirection. The instant execution of the script upon login
> increases the impact as no specific location needs to be accessed &
> potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed under the
> context of the user's session, such as session hijacking, data theft,
> or redirection to malicious sites.
